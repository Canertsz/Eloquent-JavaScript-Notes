Those are my notes that I took while studying this book.
I didn't note everything that book teaches, since some of it is basic info and not worth taking notes.

I don't recommend this book for beginners, especially if this is your first time in programming. I follow this book for strengthening my Javascript knowledge and solve challenges in it.
