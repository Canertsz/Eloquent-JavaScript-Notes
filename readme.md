Those are my notes that I took while studying this book.
I didn't note everything that book teaches, since some of it is basic info and not worth taking notes.

<b>I don't recommend this book for beginners,</b> especially if this is your first time in programming. I use this book to advance my javascript skills and solve challenges in it.
